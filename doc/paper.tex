\section{Motivation}

As computation needs keep increasing with Moore's Law one way to keep up has been
specialized architectures. FPGAs provide a way to implement architectures without taping out an ASIC.
However, the limitations of FPGA resources means some creativity is needed to map designs to FPGAs.
This paper explores the limitation of FPGAs in the fact that FPGA memories have a limited number of
ports. Specifically we look at creating memories with more than 2 ports.

The 3 major FPGA vendors implement distributed memory (small memories) and block memory (large memories)
differently, however they share some characteristics.

All 3 vendors support distributed memory configurations with 1 full port and up to 3 read ports.

All 3 vendors support block memory with 2 full ports.

\section{Source Code}
We provide all of the source code used in implementation and testing our design at
github.com/kevintownsend/mpm. We tested our design with Verilator and implemented the design
with Vivado (Xilinx/AMD).

\section{Introduction}

We propose a simple generalization to XOR memories presented in previous work.
XOR memories work by using the a xor b xor b = a property. We add bidirectional
ports and analyze the perforamance of distributed memory and block memory
versions of this design. We also present applications for these memories.

We also present a LVT memory that utizazes distrubuted memory xor live value table.

\section{Live Value Table Memory}

In (TODO citation) the live value table was implemented with registers. Previous work used
distributed memory (TODO citation). However they did not use bidirectional xor ports in their implementation.

We create a LVT memory using the technique described in (TODO cititaion). TODO: describe technique.

We show we utilize x\% less resources than LVT and I-LVT.

\section{Impractical Designs}

We obviously wanted to explore impractical designs with large numbers of ports. We say
impractical because of the high resource usage of XOR and LVT memories at high port counts.
N**2 for XOR and N*(N-1)/2 for LVT. However we were able to synthesize a 16 port memory.

Without write delay the design runs at Xmhz (x\% of max). With write delay and pipelining the design runs at Xmhz.

\section{Conclusion}
Several solutions to the port limit on FPGAs other than what is presented here.
For example multi-pumping and banking. multi-pumping is the process of reducing
the clock speed to increase the number of ports. For example a 300Mhz single
port memory can handle 2 150Mhz ports. Banking requires stalls and routing logic
due to the segmented memory. Our design uses replication and some creativity
XOR and LVT to create multiple ports.
